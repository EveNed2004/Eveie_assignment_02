                <h2 class="border2">What Is A Clef</h2>
                <p>For basics, a Clef is, the indentifier that specifies the type of sound an instrument will produce as well as the pitch of the music. depending on what type of scale an instrument is built for is what will determine the octive and clef of said instrument in which the music will be written.</p>

                <h2 class="border2">Where can a clef be found?
                </h2>
                <p>a clef will always be found at the beginning of each line of music as seen below. you can identify the clef as the little curly symbol at the beginning of each line. the top one can be indentified as the Treble clef and the bottom can be identified as the bass clef.</p>

                <h2 class="border2">What's The Difference?</h2>
                <P>The difference between the two clefs may not be entirely noticable at first however lets take a closer look. if you notice the bottom lines of msuic, are very repetitive. vs the top often changes and flows. this is because the treble instruments is often the part of the band that carry the melody while the bass is what provides a beat.  </P>
